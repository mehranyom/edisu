The first ranking of EDISU PIEMONTE for those who requested accommodation service for 2024/25 published on 11/09/2024. Since this ranking list doesn't show the overall rank of each person among all students in the same city who will request dorms inside torino, i decided to store all data into google spreadsheet and sort it to know what is my overall rank.
I decided to write a python code to extract and sort data, and then by using spreadsheet api, store sorted data into a google sheet.
